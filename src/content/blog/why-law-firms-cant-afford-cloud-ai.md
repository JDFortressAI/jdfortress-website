Over the past few months we have sat down with several people working right at the coalface of legal AI adoption in the UK: partners at mid-sized High Street firms, in-house legal teams at corporates, and sales reps who spend their days pitching tools to cautious practices.

Alex runs compliance at a 15-partner firm in Hertfordshire—mostly property, family, and small commercial work. He told me straight: “We trialled one of the big-name cloud legal AIs last year. The speed was impressive, but as soon as someone asked ‘Where exactly is our clients’ data going?’, the conversation stopped. No one could give a clean answer that satisfied the risk register.”

Jack, a partner at a long-established London practice, put it more bluntly over coffee: “I’m not anti-AI. I just can’t be the one who explains to the SRA why we sent Mrs Johnson’s divorce file to a server in California because it saved us three hours on disclosure review.”

Samantha works in legal tech sales and covers the full spectrum — from Magic Circle down to two-partner outfits. She sees the same pattern repeatedly: “The enthusiasm is there until the compliance partner or the MLRO gets involved. Then it’s all about privilege, confidentiality, and whether the tool’s terms of service create an unauthorised disclosure. Most cloud providers still can’t square that circle for regulated work.”

## The SRA Principle 6 Reality

Under SRA Principle 6 (and paragraph 6.3 of the Code of Conduct for Solicitors), confidentiality to clients is absolute — not “reasonable efforts,” not “best endeavours.” Uploading client documents to any third-party cloud service means the data leaves your controlled environment. Even with a data processing addendum in place, the SRA’s position on whether that amounts to impermissible disclosure remains unsettled in 2026. Their latest compliance tips (updated February 2026) remind firms that technology use must still satisfy the full suite of principles, including secure handling of client information. Guidance is evolving, but no one wants to be the test case.

## The CLOUD Act Isn’t Going Away

Most of the popular legal AI platforms — whether from US-headquartered providers like OpenAI, Microsoft, Thomson Reuters, or others — fall under US jurisdiction. That brings the CLOUD Act into play: US authorities can compel those companies to hand over data, even if it’s stored in European data centres. Recent commentary from law firms and data protection specialists underlines that the US–UK Data Access Agreement hasn’t eliminated the underlying exposure; it’s simply streamlined one channel for law enforcement requests.

For a High Street firm handling personal injury, conveyancing, or probate, that’s not an abstract risk — it’s a potential breach of client trust that no professional indemnity insurer wants to defend.

## What the Careful Firms Are Actually Doing

The practices that are getting real value from AI aren’t rejecting it — they’re insisting on architectures that keep the risk profile acceptable.

On-premises (or private VPC/air-gapped) deployment is the route many are taking. The model and the inference happen inside the firm’s own perimeter: no documents transit the public internet, no third-party processor touches the data, no CLOUD Act reach. The productivity lift — faster research, document summarisation, drafting first cuts — remains the same, but the compliance headache disappears.

## The Bottom Line for High Street Practices

On-premises or private AI isn’t futuristic or only for the City. Modern solutions make it realistic for firms of 2–50 solicitors without massive internal IT overhead.
The real question isn’t “Can we afford to run our own AI stack?” It’s “Can we afford the regulatory, reputational, and client-trust cost of not doing so?”

If you’re a partner or compliance lead weighing the same trade-offs Alex, Jack, and their peers are, we’re happy to talk through what a realistic, low-friction on-premises option looks like for your firm — no hard sell, just a confidential conversation.
