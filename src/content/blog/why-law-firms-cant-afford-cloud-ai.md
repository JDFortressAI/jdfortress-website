The AI revolution has arrived in the legal sector. CoCounsel, Harvey, Copilot for Legal — the market is flooded with tools promising to transform how firms do research, review documents, and draft correspondence. The efficiency gains are real. But so is the risk. And it’s a risk most law firm partners haven’t fully reckoned with.

## The SRA Principle 6 Problem

Solicitors in England and Wales operate under an absolute duty of confidentiality to their clients under SRA Principle 6. This isn’t a best-efforts obligation — it’s absolute. When you upload a client’s documents to a cloud AI service, you are transferring that data to a third party. Whether or not you have a data processing agreement in place, the question of whether that constitutes an impermissible disclosure is not settled.

The guidance from the SRA on AI use is still evolving. That means firms using cloud AI tools are operating in regulatory grey territory — with career-defining consequences if the answer turns out to be unfavourable.

## The CLOUD Act Exposure

Most of the major AI providers — OpenAI, Microsoft, Thomson Reuters, Google — are US-listed entities. That means they are subject to the US CLOUD Act, which allows US federal authorities to compel access to data held by those companies regardless of where the data is physically stored.

Your client’s matter documents, stored in a US provider’s cloud infrastructure, are reachable by US federal government. That’s not a hypothetical. It’s the legal architecture these tools operate within.

## What the Efficient Firms Are Actually Doing

The law firms navigating this well are not avoiding AI. They’re demanding a different architecture. On-premises deployment means the AI model runs inside the firm’s own infrastructure — on their servers, in their building or private VPC. The model processes documents without those documents ever leaving the firm’s network.

No cloud transit. No third-party processors. No DPA complexity. No CLOUD Act exposure.

The efficiency gains are the same. The risk profile is completely different.

## The Practical Reality

Implementing on-premises AI isn’t as complex as it sounds. Modern deployment tooling — and providers like JD Fortress AI — makes it possible for firms of 2–50 solicitors to run private AI infrastructure without a dedicated IT team.

The question isn’t whether your firm can afford on-premises AI. It’s whether you can afford the alternative.
