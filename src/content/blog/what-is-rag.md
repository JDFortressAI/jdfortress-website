If you've been trying to get your head around AI for your business, you've probably heard the term RAG. It sounds technical - and it is - but the concept is surprisingly straightforward, and the implications for businesses with sensitive data are significant.

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines two things:

1. **A large language model** (like the AI behind ChatGPT) - good at reasoning, summarising, and generating coherent text.
2. **A search system over your own documents** - so the AI can look things up in your files before answering.

The result: an AI that can answer questions using your own internal knowledge base, not just its general training data.

## A Concrete Example

Imagine you're a [law firm](/blog/why-law-firms-cant-afford-cloud-ai) with 20 years of precedents, matter files, and internal guidance documents. Normally, a junior solicitor would spend hours searching for the right case or clause. With a RAG system built over your document library, you'd simply ask: "What's our standard approach to limitation clauses in manufacturing contracts?" - and get a cited, accurate answer drawn from your own files.

No hallucination. No generic advice. Your knowledge, made instantly searchable.

## Why RAG Changes Everything for Data-Sensitive Businesses

Most AI tools work by sending your questions - and sometimes your documents - to a remote server, where a model processes them and sends back an answer. For businesses with [confidential data](/blog/chatgpt-discovery-legal-risk), that's a problem.

RAG can be deployed entirely on-premises. The language model runs inside your infrastructure. Your documents stay on your servers. The retrieval happens locally. Nothing leaves your network.

This is how JD Fortress AI builds RAG pipelines for our clients - the same architecture that powers FortiCIS, our CIS Benchmark assistant at cis.jdfortress.com.

## What RAG Is Not

RAG is not the same as giving an AI access to the internet. It's not a chatbot that guesses. And it's not a search engine that just returns links. It's a reasoning system that retrieves relevant passages from a specific, controlled document set - and uses them as the basis for a thoughtful, accurate response.

The "retrieval" step means the AI has evidence. The "generation" step means it can explain, summarise, and synthesise - not just list results.

## Is RAG Right for Your Business?

RAG is valuable for any organisation that:

- Has accumulated significant internal knowledge (documents, policies, precedents, manuals)
- Wants AI-powered search and Q&A over that knowledge
- Can't risk sending documents to public cloud AI services
- Needs cited, verifiable answers rather than AI guesswork

If that sounds like your business, we should talk.
